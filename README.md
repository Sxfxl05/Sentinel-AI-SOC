# SentinelAI SOC  
### AI-Augmented Security Operations Center with SOAR & Audit Trail

SentinelAI SOC is a **portfolio-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard** that simulates how modern SOC teams **detect, investigate, and respond** to security incidents using **automation (SOAR)** and **analyst workflows**.

This project focuses on **stability, clarity, and realism** rather than gimmicks.

## Key Features

### Threat Monitoring
- Live SOC log simulation
- Risk-based alert filtering
- Global attack path visualization

### SOC Copilot (Offline AI Logic)
- Human-readable alert explanations
- MITRE ATT&CK–style reasoning
- Analyst-friendly responses

### SOAR Automation (Core Highlight)
- One-click SOAR playbook execution
- Analyst confirmation (real-world behavior)
- Severity classification (LOW / HIGH / CRITICAL)
- **Professional incident report generation**
- **Persistent SOC audit trail**

### SOC Audit Trail
- Unique Incident ID generation
- Timestamped execution logs
- Compliance-style audit entries
- Session-persistent and refresh-safe
  
## Example SOAR Audit Report
INCIDENT REPORT
────────────────────────────────
Incident ID : INC-483921
Timestamp : 2026-01-02 14:55:10
Severity : CRITICAL
Action Taken : Contain Threat

Execution Summary
─────────────────

Malicious indicators identified

Source IP blocked at perimeter firewall

Affected user account isolated

Active sessions revoked

SOC and IR teams notified

Conclusion
──────────
Threat successfully contained. No further malicious activity observed.

Audit Status
────────────
✔ Action executed successfully
✔ Logged for compliance and review
